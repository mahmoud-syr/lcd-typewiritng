# Practicing on LCD1602 with Arudnio

For learning purposes, how to write to lcd screen in a "type-writing" style

This is a very naive and simple example to output to [LCD1602](http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=LCD1602_Module) module.
It's required to use a 10KÎ© potentiometer and connect it to `VO` pin in order to control the contrast.
